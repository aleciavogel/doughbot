Kwithpy's Discord Bot

More info will be added soon

## Getting Started

Assuming you've already created the app in the Discord Developer Portal and added the bot to your target Discord server...

1. Run `yarn` followed by `yarn prep`. This will install all dependencies and prep your dev environment.
2. In the newly created `.env` file, enter the secret tokens and IDs provided by Discord.
3. Enter `yarn start:dev` to begin running the local dev environment.
