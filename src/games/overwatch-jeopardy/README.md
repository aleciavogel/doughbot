# overwatch-jeopardy

An Overwatch-themed game of Jeopardy that members of my Discord server can play
in the `#overwatch-jeopardy` channel by writing commands to the bot.

## How to play

1. Open the `#overwatch-jeopardy` channel
2. Enter `try me` in the chat to begin a new game
3. You will have 30 seconds to answer. All other members of the channel will also
    have the opportunity to try and answer before the time is up
4. If you answer, your score will be updated by the prize amount depending on
    whether you're correct or not.
